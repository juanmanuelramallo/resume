# Juan Manuel Ramallo

Hey!


## I'm a
Software engineer that writes and reads Ruby code during office hours—well, outside too. I'm good enough with Javascript to realize that [_imightnotneedjquery_](https://youmightnotneedjquery.com/) and also that _new Date().getDay()_ is not the day of the month—duh. Code reviews have been the place where I've learned the most, [that's why I spend a considerable amount of time](https://github.com/juanmanuelramallo/#:~:text=More-,Activity%20overview,-Contributed%20to) in the day examining my teammates code, to keep learning and passing on the things I've learned.

## Lately
I've been spending some time digging into macroeconomics, thanks to a course by outlier.org. While crypto is not really related to macroeconomics at all, I think it's one of the reasons that got me into studying a bit more about economics. I'm also quite fond of old video games, some saturday afternoons you could find me doing some competitive Counter Strike or a few ranked matches in Age of Empires II. There's always time for some piano playing in the evening, I used to teach Introduction to Music Theory and Piano in a local music institute.

## I work for
Growth Nirvana, a marketing analytics tool aiming to get you up and running in minutes, not months. We use Rails for our backend, sprinkles of Hotwire in our frontend, and some external partners like Google Cloud Platform to house all the data and other services. We are a small group of people so my role not only consists on adding new features to our app but also ensuring we, as a team, maintain the same quality on the code we deliver to our customers—as this is mostly a B2B product. I appreciate the freedom I have at Growth Nirvana to build and design the solutions to the problems we face, but what I found myself missing at the moment is the information exchange between senior engineers, the feedback from people that is more experienced than me in engineering and architecturing solutions.

I also work as a teacher assistant for the Software Engineering course at Universidad Nacional de la Plata. I mentioned this because this is the course where I learned about Rails seven years ago. Three years ago I started working as an ad honorem teacher in the practical part of the subject, helping other young students build their first web applications with Rails, give their first steps with databases, and also grasp a little bit of HTTP.

I'm eager to work on new challenges, contribute alongside experienced people and help you keep building the great products you have.

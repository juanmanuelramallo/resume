_[growthnirvana.com](https://www.growthnirvana.com/)_

- In house - joined at the conception of Growth Nirvana, a marketing analytics tool, to help build the basement of the system and its integrations. Job involves working on a Rails app that heavily communicates with Google Cloud services and external data providers. Data parity is maintained via a set of background jobs that run either periodically or when an event occurrs ensuring all data is up to date. Data is later consumed via custom-made and reusable SQL scripts that run in a data warehouse.

- In house - worked two months on Mailtrap's codebase, started working on a new role based access control system. Also contributed to several areas of the app, i.e. _[improving the tests execution time](https://leonid.shevtsov.me/post/how-to-make-rails-feature-tests-twice-as-fast/#:~:text=execution%20time%20twofold.-,Skip%20login,-\(and%20other%20repetitive)_.
